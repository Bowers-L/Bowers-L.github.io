During the ideation process, our team decided that we wanted to create a variation on the Tower Defense genre.\n    We noticed that in some tower defense games, the player is given significantly less to do while the enemies attack \n    the towers. While most modern tower defenses allow the player to purchase towers during the levels, the major decisions\n    are usually made between levels. We decided to subvert this idea by making the towers rotate in 3 levels with a central disk. \n    <br>\n    My major contribution to the game came in the form of the tower programming as well as the visual effects for the towers. While the two \n    dog towers were relatively straightforward, the lighthouse tower (a tower that slows down enemies within a disk radius), required some more effort.\n    My implementation involved programming a particle system to create a ring around the tower that programmatically extends outward.

I would consider this my first real experience creating a full 3D game with Unity, and it helped\n    shape my experiences creating Unity games later on. \n</div>\n\n<div class="paragraph">\n    During the development of this game, I designed and implemented the combat system, as well as rigging the player\'s animations \n    using state machines. I was heavily inspired by the Dark Souls series of games when designing the combat and \n    got to experience first hand the interconnectedness between animation and balanced gameplay. I spent time tweaking animation\n    speeds/durations as well as hitbox sizes and active hitbox/hurtbox windows to achieve a better balance. I noticed early on that\n    it was easy for the player to "tank" hits and get through all the combat by mashing buttons, so I also implemented a stamina\n    system as well as a stagger system. The stagger system (known as "poise" in the Souls games) ensures that the player gets punished \n    with a stagger animation if they get hit too many times. \n    <br>\n    The main mechanic of the game\'s boss, "Hugh Mann", pushes the player back and causes them to fall whenever they get hit. This was achieved by\n    adding additional states to the player\'s state machine as well as adding a behaviour script that applies a force pointing away from the hitbox of the boss. \n</div>\n\n<div class="paragraph center">\n    <img class="pc-screenshot" src="img/projects/AgentGunne/AgentGunneGameplay1.png" alt="Agent Gunne Gameplay" />\n    <img class="pc-screenshot" src="img/projects/AgentGunne/AgentGunneGameplay2.png" alt="Agent Gunne Gameplay" />\n</div>\n',"#5D4B3C"),g=new s["a"]("beatdown","BeatDown","img/projects/Beatdown-icon.png",'\n<div class="paragraph center">\n    <iframe class="youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8H40PtNLm68" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<div class = "paragraph">\nProject Info:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Genre: 2D Rhythm/Top Down</li>\n<li>Engine: Unity/C#</li>\n<li>Team Size: 13</li>\n<li>Contribution: Programmer, Level Design</li>\n<li>Timeframe: Spring 2021</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div class="notice">\nPlay the game <a href=https://abnormal202.itch.io/beatdown target="_blank">here</a>\n</div>\n\n<div class="paragraph">\n    <strong>BeatDown</strong> is a 2D rhythm game led by <a href="https://www.drewbusch.com/">Drew Busch</a> and developed in Spring 2021 as part of the VGDev Club at Georgia Tech. It has a unique game mechanic in that you are able to move\n    a player shape along a stage grid each time you hit the beat. The game features a charge mechanic that allows you to crush opponents, as well as powerups and ultimates. \n</div>\n\n<div class="paragraph center">\n    <img class="pc-screenshot" src="img/projects/BeatDown/BeatDownGameplay1.webp" alt="BeatDown Gameplay" />\n    <img class="pc-screenshot" src="img/projects/BeatDown/BeatDownGameplay2.webp" alt="BeatDown Gameplay" />\n</div>\n\n<div class="paragraph">\n    My primary contribution to BeatDown was the design/implementation of the ultimate system. I wanted to design the system such that it incentivizes optimal gameplay while \n    feeling balanced. The player gains an amount of ultimate charge by moving in conjunction with the beat, however, the player can also gain bonus charge by maintaining note streaks\n    and by killing opposing players. The player is also awarded more charge for "moving" rather than "charging". This incentivizes the player to move around the map more rather than waiting in\n    one corner. By giving each individual shape a different ultimate, the player is awarded a variety in playstyle based on their character choice. For example, the circle is incentivized to follow\n    other players closely since it\'s ultimate decimates players in its immediate vicinity, whereas the square wants to use powerups to limit other players\' space and snipe them from farther away.\n    <br><br>\n    In terms of implementation, I took advantage of Unity\'s Scriptable Objects to easily tune values for balance purposes. I also used object oriented design to create separate coroutines for each ultimate\n    while providing an interface to the main player scripts. \n</div>\n',"#5a78af"),u=[l,c["a"],m["a"],d,h["a"],g,p],v=r["a"].extend({name:"GameProjects",components:{ProjectsList:o["a"]},data:function(){return{projects:u}}}),f=v,b=(a("09b0"),a("2877")),w=Object(b["a"])(f,n,i,!1,null,"cef10562",null);t["default"]=w.exports},"51fa":function(e,t,a){"use strict";var n=a("1cd5"),i=a.n(n);i.a},"5ced":function(e,t,a){},"5f95":function(e,t,a){"use strict";var n=a("c8ef"),i=a.n(n);i.a},"67f3":function(e,t,a){"use strict";var n=a("ee3f"),i=a.n(n);i.a},"710a":function(e,t,a){"use strict";var n=a("983d");t["a"]=new n["a"]("slider","GDC 2023 IGF Finalist: Slider","img/projects/Slider-main.png",'\n<div class="notice">\n<strong>Slider</strong> is a game led by \n<a href="https://randomerz.com" target="_blank">Daniel Carr</a> \nand getting released \n<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1916890/Slider/" target="_blank">On Steam</a> (eventually).<br>\n</div>\n\n<div class="paragraph center">\n    <iframe class="youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dihp4vlx4gA?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<div class = "paragraph">\nProject Info:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Genre: 2D Top Down Puzzle Exploration</li>\n<li>Engine: Unity/C#</li>\n<li>Team Size: 30+</li>\n<li>Contribution: Graphics/Gameplay/AI/Tools Programmer, Shader Engineer, Level Design</li>\n<li>Timeframe: Spring 2022 to Present</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div class="paragraph">\n<br><br>\n\n Slider is by far the most high profile game project I\'ve worked on (as of Spring 2023), \n having been demoed at multiple local and GT events, including <b>Dreamhack Atlanta 2022</b>, and being recently selected as an <b>IGF finalist</b> for best student game <b>@ GDC 2023</b>.<br><br>\n\nThat being said, the game is also the largest and most complex game I\'ve worked on, and it has been quite the journey developing key gameplay systems that are used in several of the game\'s areas.\nWith both an Ocean and a Mountain of content (literally), I have probably gained more experience working on this project than the rest of my projects combined, especially with working within such a large team for a student project.<br><br>\n</div>\n\n<div class="paragraph">\n    I was responsible for the development of multiple gameplay systems and tools, including (but not limited to):\n    <ul>\n        <li>A Move Queue System with Interrupts</li>\n        <li>Custom Dynamic Lighting with Shaders/Light Maps.</li>\n        <li>Custom Pathfinding for NPCs in a 2D Tilemap</li>\n        <li>AI Behaviour Trees and Steering (The Infamous Rat)</li>\n        <li>An NPC Event-Based Dialogue System with designer customization</li>\n        <li>An Electricity/Power gameplay system with a dynamic graph structure</li>\n        <li>Countless bug fixes, optimizations, and refactors over the span of a year for a growing codebase</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    Each one of these bullets really deserves its own page, and I would love to go into a deeper\n    dive on some of these systems in the future.

The GBA also does not have a dedicated OS, so memory management was\n    a definite consideration. \n    <br>\n    Part of the challenge in developing this game was fitting the map of the game world into the \n    limitations of the Video Memory (VRAM). The GBA only allows up to a 512x512 pixel background, which is split into 4 256x256 pixel screenblocks. In order\n    to create the illusion of a map that is larger than 512x512, screenblocks need to be loaded into the VRAM periodically offscreen\n    based on the position of the player\'s camera. Loading these screenblocks seamlessly requires a technique called DMA, which uses dedicated\n    hardware to quickly copy one section of memory to another. This process is significantly faster than using coded loops since it offloads\n    work from the CPU and uses fewer context switches.\n    <br> \n    Another challenge in the GBA is sound. The GBA has two dedicated sound channels. In order to play a sound in one of the channels, the sound needs\n    to be continuously sampled at a rate relative to the processor speed. This is achieved by using DMA to continuously feed samples of the sound into a \n    dedicated memory slot that the speaker can read at the rate of the processor. In order to ensure that this happens, a hardware timer is set to trigger an interrupt at intervals\n    based on the sampling frequency, which then allows the DMA to feed the next sample to the specified channel. \n    <br>\n    Overall, creating a metroid style game within the confines of the GBA required multiple programming solutions to get done. In hindsight, I recognized multiple\n    areas in game design and level design that could be improved, such as the ending section. This gave me an appreciation for the flexibility that modern engines\n    provide in allowing developers to focus on design decisions over implementation details. \n</div>\n',"#e80fb7"),h=new s["a"]("less-tris","Cpp-Tris/GBA-Tris/PI-Tris","img/projects/SpeakEasy-TitleColor.png","\nComing Soon ...\n\n<ul>\n<li>Genre: Block Falling Game</li>\n<li>Engine: C++ OpenGL, Game Boy Advance, and Java Processing + Raspberry PI</li>\n<li>Team Size: 2</li>\n<li>Contribution: Everything (Except some programming in the Raspberry PI version)</li>\n<li>Timeframe:\n<ul>\n    <li>OpenGL: Fall 2022\n    <li>GBA: Spring-Summer 2020\n    <li>Java Processing: Spring 2019\n</ul>\n","#23bd69"),d=[l,c,h],m=r["a"].extend({name:"GameProjects",components:{ProjectsList:o["a"]},data:function(){return{projects:d}}}),p=m,g=(a("51fa"),a("2877")),u=Object(g["a"])(p,n,i,!1,null,"691572ca",null);t["default"]=u.exports},"86ba":function(e,t,a){"use strict";var n=a("983d");t["a"]=new n["a"]("beam","A project I led: Beam","img/projects/Beam-start.png",'\n<div class="notice">\n<strong>Beam</strong> is a 3D first person puzzle game led by <a href="bowers-l.github.io">me</a> and developed in Fall 2021 by the Georgia Tech VGDev club.<br>\n<a href=https://l-cpp.itch.io/beam target="_blank">Play the game here!</a>\n</div>\n\n<div class="paragraph center">\n    <iframe class="youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mg_dVNZKB9U?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<div class = "paragraph">\nProject Info:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Genre: 3D First Person Puzzle</li>\n<li>Engine: Unity/C#</li>\n<li>Team Size: 6</li>\n<li>Contribution: Project Lead, Level Designer, Programmer, VFX Artist</li>\n<li>Timeframe: Fall 2021</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class="paragraph">\nI came up with the initial design and prototype, pitched the game to \n the club, and was the project lead during development.<br><br>\n \n This was my first time leading a team for a game and really tested my leadership and production skills, putting me in a position that (at the time) I was not used to.

In order to \n    accomplish this, I outlined a suggested pipeline for creating levels:\n    <ul>\n    <li><b>Concept Design</b>- Come up with the general mechanics/concept that the level will test.</li>\n    <li><b>Mockup</b> - Draw a top-down view of what the level with look like, including the solution.</li>\n    <li><b>Greybox</b> - Block out the important level geometry in Unity (we used ProBuilder for this)</li>\n    <li><b>Playtest</b> - Make sure the level is beatable. Look for alternative solutions.</li>\n    <li><b>Analyze/Modify</b> - Make changes to the level based on feedback from playtesting. Do more playtesting/modifications if necessary.</li>\n    <li><b>Polish</b> - Clean up the geometry. Add textures, lighting, narration, etc.</li>\n    </ul>\n    Playtesting during development was essential for gauging how difficult the puzzles were and how balanced the player felt compared to their environment. <br><br>\n\n    One of the biggest challenges was creating puzzles that didn\'t softlock. In the end, we implemented a strategy used by other puzzle \n    games such as <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/257510/The_Talos_Principle><b>The Talos Principle</b></a> and <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You><b>Baba is You</b></a>, which\n    is to have a dedicated reset button to reset the level at any time.\n\n    <br><br>\n\n    Overall, I gained an intuitive understanding of what makes a game fun (specifically in the puzzle genre). It is important to create simple mechanics with a complex ceiling and to construct the environment in a way \n    that restricts player choice just enough to allow for creative problem solving. The biggest challenge for the team and myself was definitely making levels that are the right amount of difficult while still being fun to solve.\n    <br><br>\n    \n    Nonetheless, it was a rewarding experience, and I definitely learned a thing or two about design that I can use to make even better games in the future. \n\n</div>\n\n\n',"#23bd69")},"896e":function(e,t,a){},"8cdb":function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t);var n=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,a=e._self._c||t;return a("div",{staticClass:"http-404"},[e._v("404 🙈")])},i=[],r=(a("67f3"),a("2877")),o={},s=Object(r["a"])(o,n,i,!1,null,"c64612d2",null);t["default"]=s.exports},"919f":function(e,t,a){"use strict";var n=a("983d");t["a"]=new n["a"]("blood-favor","Blood Favor","img/projects/BloodFavor-icon.PNG",'\n<div class="notice">\n<strong>Blood Favor</strong> was developed and led by <a href=https://www.drewbusch.com/>Drew Busch</a> as part of VGDev\'s Fall 2022 Lineup.<br>\n<a href=https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1LXZSTCk6FtoOHlNmT2b0CPPvX6QOnHRe>Play a Demo of the game Here</a>\n</div>\n\n<div class="paragraph center">\n    <div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:40%;">\n        <iframe src="vid/Blood_Favor_Promo_video.mp4" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class = "paragraph">\nProject Info:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Genre: 3D First Person Shooter; Roguelike</li>\n<li>Engine: Unity/C#</li>\n<li>Team Size: 60+</li>\n<li>Contribution: Gameplay Systems Sublead, Tools Programmer, Procedural Generation</li>\n<li>Timeframe: Fall 2022</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div class="paragraph">\nI was the gameplay systems sublead ("Technical Lead") for the project and was responsible for major parts of the procedural level generator system that the game depended on.<br><br>\n</div>\n\n<div class = "paragraph">\nI was responsible for implementating the Blood Favor Level Generator (BFLG, pronounced BiFfeL Gee), and the accompanying Blood Favor Level Editor for Level Flows (BFLELF, pronounced BiFfeL ELF).\n<br><br>\n\nIn addition, I created a document <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iWgXdkIWWc7WgB21o7b0cbR-UYOIgJ0AObaCWrbMUKk><strong>Here</strong></a> for aiding designers in using the BFLELF tool effectively: <br><br>\n</div>\n<div class="paragraph center">\n    <div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:40%;">\n        <iframe src="gifs/10_06_BFLELF.gif" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class="paragraph center">\n    <div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:40%;">\n        <iframe src="gifs/10_06_BFLG.gif" frameborder="0" width="50%" height="50%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class = "paragraph">\nSince Blood Favor is a Roguelike, the level layout for the game is procedurally generated (rooms are hand crafted).
